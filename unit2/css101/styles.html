    <h1>BLOCK ELEMENT</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>A Block element, by default, takes up all of the space to the right and left, internal to it's parent</li>
        <li>A Block can can have height and width </li>
        <li>Nothing can ever be on either side (internal to the parent)because it's 100%. if you change the width, it will just add margin.
            Blocks will ignore margin you add, because they already have 100%
        </li>
        <li>Can be > 100%</li>

    </ol>

    <h1>Inline elements</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Respect left and right padding, left and right margin
        but will ignore top and bottom</li>
        <li>2. Couldn't care less what is left or right.</li>
        <li>3. With a few exceptions (namely images) you CANNOT tell an inline
        element how big to be.</li>
        <li>4. Will happily ignore all block level rules unless forced to do so</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Inline Block</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>. Can have stuff on either side (inline positive)</li>1
        <li>2. Can have height/width (block positive)</li>
        <li>3. Can have top/bottom padding/margin (block positive)</li>
    </ol>
